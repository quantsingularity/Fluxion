## Synthetic Asset Liquidity Engine

Fluxion is a synthetic asset platform: a FastAPI backend for portfolios, transactions, risk, and compliance, a React web dashboard, and a React Native (Expo) mobile app. Alongside the application is a set of Foundry-managed Solidity contracts for minting and liquidating synthetic assets and a real zero-knowledge circuit for private price commitments, plus a small PyTorch research library for forecasting and risk scoring.

## Overview

Fluxion demonstrates a synthetic asset workflow across a real, runnable codebase. The application tier (backend, smart contracts, and two clients) is wired and covered by tests. The Solidity contracts and the zero-knowledge circuit are genuinely implemented; a small PyTorch research library (forecasting, risk prediction) sits alongside the application but is not yet called by the live API, which currently returns a deterministic placeholder prediction instead.

## Feature Status

### Application tier (wired and tested)

| Component                      | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API**                        | FastAPI backend exposing endpoints under `/api/v1` for health, auth, users, portfolio, transactions, analytics, markets, compliance, and risk.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Auth**                       | bcrypt password hashing, JWT access and refresh tokens, TOTP-based MFA (pyotp), and API key management. `SECRET_KEY` must be at least 32 characters; the shipped default already satisfies that check, so unlike some sibling projects it is not rejected outright in production. |
| **Portfolio and risk engines** | Real in-process Python logic for VaR, Expected Shortfall, Sharpe and Sortino ratios, max drawdown, beta, concentration and liquidity risk, stress testing, portfolio performance, and rebalancing recommendations.                                                                |
| **Collateral engine**          | Mint, burn, and liquidate logic with price-staleness checks and collateral-ratio calculations, run in-process by the backend.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Smart contracts**            | Foundry-managed Solidity 0.8 contracts: a synthetic asset factory (implements a vault interface, pulls prices via Chainlink's `AggregatorV3Interface` and the Chainlink Any-API request/fulfill pattern), a liquidity pool manager, a liquidation engine, and a governance token. |
| **Zero-knowledge layer**       | A real Circom circuit (`price_commitment.circom`) with a matching `Groth16Verifier.sol` contract for private price commitments.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Web dashboard**              | React app covering Home, Dashboard, Synthetics, Pools (including pool creation), Portfolio, Transactions, Analytics, Settings, and authentication screens.                                                                                                                        |
| **Mobile app**                 | React Native (Expo) app covering the same functional areas through React Navigation's bottom-tab and stack navigators.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Guest login**                | Both clients recognize a local demo session and keep working, with placeholder data, if the backend is unreachable.                                                                                                                                                               |

### Research tier (library modules)

| Component                       | Details                                                                                                                                                            |
| :------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Forecasting models**          | LSTM and Transformer time-series models (PyTorch) for price and liquidity forecasting.                                                                             |
| **Financial risk predictor**    | PyTorch model for risk scoring.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Anomaly detection**           | A standalone anomaly-detection module, separate from the Isolation Forest model that the backend's own threat-detection service uses for live security monitoring. |
| **Liquidity training pipeline** | Scripts to train a liquidity-prediction model.                                                                                                                     |

These modules are unit-tested and importable, but the live `/api/v1/predict` endpoint returns a deterministic placeholder forecast rather than calling into this library, and the `ml-service` container defined in Docker Compose is a minimal health and metrics stub with the same inference not yet wired in.

## Testing

```bash
# Smart contracts (from code/blockchain)
forge test

# Backend (from code/backend)
pytest

# Web (from web-frontend)
npm test

# Mobile (from mobile-frontend)
npm test
```

The backend suite includes unit tests for auth, collateralization, the data pipeline, and the user service, plus integration tests for the auth endpoints. The Foundry suite covers each Solidity contract individually, including the Groth16 verifier. Neither the web nor the mobile suite currently includes end-to-end tests.

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/cicd.yml`) runs five jobs on push, pull request, and manual dispatch:

| Job                            | Depends on          | What it does                                                                                        |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code Quality Checks            | -                   | Python formatter checks (autoflake, black) and a repository-wide Prettier check, including Solidity |
| Backend Tests                  | Code Quality Checks | Runs the pytest suite with coverage and uploads the coverage report as an artifact                  |
| Web-Frontend Test & Build      | Code Quality Checks | Runs the frontend test suite and produces the production build                                      |
| Mobile-Frontend Test & Build   | Code Quality Checks | Runs the Jest suite and produces the Expo web export                                                |
| Smart Contracts Compile & Test | Code Quality Checks | Installs Foundry dependencies, compiles the contracts, and runs `forge test` with a gas report      |
