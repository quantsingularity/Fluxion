/**
 * Token / price-feed registry for pool creation and synthetic asset UI.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this app's contracts (FACTORY_ADDRESS, POOL_MANAGER_ADDRESS in
 * env.js) can be deployed to any network — mainnet, a testnet, or a local
 * Anvil/Hardhat chain — and that choice isn't hardcoded anywhere else in
 * this codebase. Hardcoding real Ethereum mainnet token addresses as the
 * *default* registry would be actively wrong (and dangerous — silent calls
 * to unrelated contracts at those addresses) on any other network. So:
 *
 *   - `getAssetRegistry()` first checks VITE_ASSET_REGISTRY_JSON, a
 *     deployment-specific JSON array the operator provides (same pattern
 *     as VITE_FACTORY_ADDRESS / VITE_POOL_MANAGER_ADDRESS in env.js).
 *   - If unset, it falls back to `MAINNET_REFERENCE_ASSETS` below, but only
 *     as an opt-in convenience surfaced in the UI as "Ethereum Mainnet
 *     reference — verify these match your connected network" — never
 *     silently assumed to be correct for whatever chain the wallet is
 *     actually on.
 *
 * Each entry: { symbol, address, decimals, oracle, oracleHeartbeatSeconds }
 *   - address: ERC-20 token contract address (used as the `assets[]` entry
 *     for LiquidityPoolManager.createPool / as collateralToken for
 *     SyntheticAssetFactory.createSynthetic)
 *   - oracle: Chainlink AggregatorV3Interface price feed address for that
 *     token, used as the `oracles[]` entry for createPool
 *   - oracleHeartbeatSeconds: that feed's staleness threshold, used as the
 *     `heartbeats[]` entry for createPool
 *
 * MAINNET_REFERENCE_ASSETS only includes entries independently verified
 * against Etherscan (tokens) and Chainlink's own data.chain.link pages
 * (price feeds) at the time this was written — deliberately incomplete
 * rather than including anything unverified.
