# Fluxion Automation Scripts

This package contains a set of automation scripts designed to enhance the development, testing, deployment, and monitoring processes for the Fluxion synthetic asset liquidity engine.

## Scripts Overview

1. **deploy_multi_env.sh** - Multi-environment deployment automation
2. **cross_chain_test.sh** - Cross-chain testing framework
3. **ai_ml_pipeline.sh** - AI/ML model training and deployment pipeline
4. **monitoring_setup.sh** - Monitoring and alerting system setup

## Installation

1. Extract the zip file to your Fluxion project root directory
2. Make all scripts executable:
   ```
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```

## Usage

Each script includes detailed help information accessible via the `--help` flag:

```bash
./deploy_multi_env.sh --help
./cross_chain_test.sh --help
./ai_ml_pipeline.sh --help
./monitoring_setup.sh --help
```

```

## Validation

All scripts have been validated for:

- Syntax correctness
- Documentation quality
- Basic functionality
- Cross-script compatibility

See the validation report in the `validation` directory for details.

## Customization

Each script uses configuration files that should be placed in specific directories:

- Deployment configs: `./infrastructure/deployment/configs/`
- Test configs: `./infrastructure/test/configs/`
- AI/ML configs: `./code/ai/configs/`
- Monitoring configs: `./infrastructure/monitoring/configs/`
